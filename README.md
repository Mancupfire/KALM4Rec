**KALM4Rec** aims to tackle  the cold-start recommendation problem (where users lack historical data) by requiring only a few input keywords from users in a practical scenario of cold-start user restaurant recommendations. 

## 🛍️ Keyword-driven Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models for Cold-start User Recommendations [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19612)

 Our framework is built upon two essential components centered around keywords: candidates retrieval focusing on **retrieving relevant restaurants** and **LLM-ranker** which leverages LLM to re-rank the retrieved candidates.
 
 ## 🚀 Quick Start
 Installation
    We recommend installing Gradio using pip, which is included by default in Python. Run this in your terminal or command prompt:
   
   ```bash
   pip install gradio
   ```
Now, run your code. If you've written the Python code in a file named, for example, [app.py], then you would run [python app.py] from the terminal.
